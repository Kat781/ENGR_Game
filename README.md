# ENGR_MusicalGame
a whimsical ear training game


In this game, the goal is to determine whether the scale you are hearing is a major or a minor scale. The game will have you guess major or minor for a scale by clicking the left button for minor or the right button for major. Your goal is to get 5 points, which you get by guessing correctly before the time limit runs out. If the time limit runs out you loose the round. The user can turn the game on and off using the slide switch and guess the scale with the buttons. When you guess correctly the lights will turn green and a happy song will play and when you guess wrong a bad song will play with red lights, and when you loose or win, the lights will turn green or red. The points the player has will be displayed in white on the LEDs

Inputs of the game: Buttons, Slideswitch
Outputs of the game: Sounds/song/scale functions and light funtions
