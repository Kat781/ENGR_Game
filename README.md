# ENGR_MusicalGame
a whimsical ear training game

My game is to have a guessing game as to whether the scale or song played is 
in major or minor. There will be two game modes; one where it is songs that are
played and one that has scales get played. The positive button will correspond to
a major scale, while the negative button will correspond to the minor scale. 
Once you get 5 points in either game mode you win, and you get points if you guess the scale right. 
When you guess the scale right it will flash green, and when you get it wrong the lights will flash red. 
Score will be kept in white on the leds whenever the game isn't flashing. 
Maybe have a time limit on how much time you get to guess.
